# What is a Domain Name System?

A Domain Name System turns website addresses that  humans use such as Google.com into IP addresses that computers use to connect the internet.
This means that every website has a unique IP adress associated with it. You can also use these IP addresses in the search bar directly to connect to a website as long as you find a dedicated IP address. Check below for an example!

| Human Name | Computer Name |
| ------ | ------ |
| https://www.google.com/ | 142.250.189.228 |          ![]https://www.akamai.com/site/en/images/article/2023/how-dns-works.png

Now that you know a little about DNS, it's time to learn of DNS servers. DNS servers are where your internet connection go when you type in a new website name into the search bar. These servers resolve the human name into a computer name. Some of these DNS servers are better than others in speed, security, and avalibility. Sometimes you will fail to connect to websites because your DNS failed to find the IP, or most likley because the DNS server is down. Check out my quick tutorial below and learn how change your DNS server!
